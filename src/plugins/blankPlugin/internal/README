 BLANK INTERNAL PLUGIN TEMPLATE
--------------------------------

The blankInternalPlugin.js file is a simple Handsontable plugin template, made to help you create more consistent Handsontable
extensions.
What "internal" means in this context is "built in ES6 (ES 2015) and compiled along with Handsontable sources using the HOT Builder".

There are a few things to keep in mind while writing the "internal" plugins:

1. They need to be written in ES6 (ES2015)
2. They need to inherit from the BasePlugin class
3. They need to follow the guidlines provided in the blankInternalPlugin.js comments.
4. To keep the code as clean as possible, we use the JSCS code style checker. Our current JSCS settings are listed in the .jscsrc file in the root directory.
